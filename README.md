## FunFox Test Introduction
This is a Task management system built on React as a coding test from FunFox by Shahzada M. Salman. This includes Creating Tasks, displaying tasks and it has 2 groups created called groupA and groupB and at the moment the Mock DB has 4 users called user1, user2 whom belong to groupA and user3, user4 whom belong to groupB

groupA users can only see and update their groups tasks and same is for the groupB users.

I've added drag and drop animation to the tasks.

The website is responsive, Plus I've added minor animations for different actions like adding or deleting tasks and toaster to have more accessability.

you can click on the incomplete text button to complete the task and you can click on it again to make it incomplete.

I've created Mock Api's and DB to duplicate the backend functionality and have created a login system.

for state management I opted out to use context Api because it was a small project otherwise I can go with Redux for state management.


## Starting the project

1. Run the command "npm i" to install the dependencies
2. Run the command "npm start" to run the project and it would give you a url in your terminal "http://localhost:5173/"
